# BoxesShop
The general idea of the project is to get an offer from client about boxes he wants.
The box he wants has width and height.
The logic in the project is to get the data from the client about: width, height and quantity of the boxes he wants and check whether there are enough boxes that suitable for the client, and if not to give an alternative offer.
The alternative offer is based on constant percentages from the width and height of the box the client wanted (So it will be a little bigger box).
Also, the alternative offer based on the quantity - it will check whether there are enough boxes and if not the manager will check for other boxes that are in the scale size and will include them in the alternative offer.
The project spererated for 2 parts:
1. The manager - Controlling over the quantity, gives back offers (Logic)
2. The client - Simple console app to let the user decide what boxes(width and height) he wants and to get an offer/alternative offer and decide whether to pruchase or not.
